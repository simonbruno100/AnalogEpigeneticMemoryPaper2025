README – Code Repository for Main and Supplementary Figures

This repository contains all the MATLAB scripts and documentation necessary to reproduce the simulations and computational analyses presented in the main paper and supplementary information.
Each folder in the repository corresponds to one or more figures in the manuscript and includes:
•	Simulation scripts: Main .m files used to generate the data and plots.
•	Supporting functions: Custom MATLAB functions (e.g., Gillespie simulation routines).
•	Instructions: A README file or comments within the scripts that explain how to use the code, how to modify key parameters (e.g., initial conditions, simulation length), and how to interpret or visualize the output.
Where needed, additional helper scripts (e.g., for logicle scale visualization or violin plots) are included and referenced in each folder’s documentation.

How to Use
1.	Open the folder corresponding to the figure of interest (e.g., FIGURE_4H, FIGURE_3I).
2.	Follow the instructions in the README file or the header of the main script.
3.	Make sure to have all dependencies in your MATLAB path.
4.	Run the main script to reproduce the plots shown in the paper.
